psmisc
======

This package contains five little utilities that use the proc FS:

  fuser     identifies processes using files or sockets (similar to Sun's
	    or SGI's fuser)
  killall   kills processes by name, e.g. killall -HUP named
  pidof	    like killall, buts lists PIDs instead of killing processes
  pstree    shows the currently running processes as a tree
  peekfd    shows the data travelling over a file descriptor

They should work with most recent kernels. Man pages are included.

src/loop.h was stolen from util-linux package which in turn stole it from
the Linux kernel.

fuser on network fs
-------------------
On network filesystems, fuser can hang because its trying to stat files
that may go away.  If you use the --with-timeout-stat option during
the configure step then fuser will fork a process to run stat. This means
fuser doesn't hang, but it is much slower.

Translations
------------
My thanks for the various translators who have cheerfully given me the po
files to make psmisc speak different languages.  If your language is not
supported then let me know, all it takes is translating one file in 
a certain manner.

Icons
-----
The pstree icons were drawn by Tatlin at Coresis who has given permission
for them to be used for psmisc.

Copyright Change
----------------

The license has changed to GPL for version 20 onwards with permission
of the original authors.  People who want to use these programs under
the previous license will have to look at psmisc 19 or below.
